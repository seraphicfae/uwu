#### Why?

Because I need to fill my blog with thoughts I have.

I've been using Linux since May 6, 2024. I think sharing my
Thoughts after using Linux for over a year could be nice.
As a somewhat average person, with somewhat average needs,
Linux has been great for me! I haven't really had any issues.
That wasn't caused by user error. I think that says something,
Considering I'm using arch, btw. I started using it because, well,
I could either go with BSD (No, thanks) or Windows (didn't suit my needs),
Or, macOS (Would need to buy Apple hardware). Linux was free and open source,
Which to some people doesn't mean much, but to me, I like to treat it as a bonus.


#### What do I think of it so far?

Yeah, it's pretty cool. I get to basically have an awesome desktop with
A bunch of features I wouldn't have on any other OS, and I get to use
Everything I would normally use without any problems. Gaming is still a
Core issue of Linux. Luckily, all of my games work. I literally do not have
Any issues with Linux, none at all.

#### Would I switch to any other OS?

God no. I have no reason to, they all lack what I like. I get to have
A cool rice (which you can find <u>[here](https://seraphicfae.dev/projects/dotfiles)</u>).

#### I want to get into Linux, how can I?

<b>Consume Linux content.</b> Just dive right into it. I think if you're genuinely interested
About a topic, you're more likely to understand things (duh). I say, load up a virtual machine (VM)
And try Linux right away. Tinker with it. Try to drive it daily inside that VM until you're comfortable.
Enough install it on your own OS. A common issue that many had (so did I), was picking a distribution.
In my opinion, it doesn't matter. Pick with whatever sticks. I would only recommend a couple of distros.

- <u>[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)</u>, the best distro, but not for everyone.
- <u>[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)</u>, 2nd best distro, very standardized.
- <u>[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)</u>, 3rd best distro, offers a very simple setup.

These offer the widest differences in each system. E.g: All come with different desktop environments (DEs),
Different package managers (Pacman, Rpm, and Apt), and each have their own uniqueness to them. Would I consider
Any distros outside these main three bad? No. These are just my personal opinions. Outside these distros,
Some start to blend together, or stand out too much. You can choose a distro outside these three, but if you're looking
For my thoughts, here they are.

#### The end

Cool, thanks for listening, I guess? I don't really know what to do with blogs, I just have them.
This isn't meant to be professional or anything, just something I can have fun with.
And uhh, if you need to contact me or something, good luck!
